<p><em>Disclaimer: recent reports suggest that the upcoming collection of factoids is not an accurate depiction of the current state of reality. Also, I’m a biased hater; if you have a moment to spare and a great desire to make the world a better place, feel free to show me the advantages Java has over C++ for an advanced, experienced user.</em></p>

<p class="parind">Once upon a time  there was Java. It became so popular, people started recommending it as an introduction programming language for the masses. The times of incessant memory leaks, corruption errors, buffer overflows were gone. With its intuitive syntax and content management came Sun’s JVM, which allowed for then-unheard-of portability and scalability.</p>

<p class="parind">Well, guess what, Microsoft doesn’t seem to like it much.</p>

<p class="parind">You’d think that, when it comes to an operating system that’s been a piece of software used by the majority of the people in the world until recent years, having an access to (arguably) basic, prevalent technologies is a given. That apparently doesn’t apply to WP8 (and, most probably, previous versions), which, to my surprise, as a WinRT based OS (specifically WPRT) has no JVM supplied with it or available from other vendors. Colour me intrigued.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-all-this">So what is all this?</h2>

<p>ygc is going to be an ongoing effort to produce a stable, robust and minimalist client for playing Go, both alone (hopefully) and against other people, using the most popular means of connecting players (P2P over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as well as multiplayer over an IGS server). It will also let you record and watch replays, read commentary attached to it, solve problems and publish your own content of that sort to the rest of the userbase. All that on Windows Phone 8 and later. It sounds neat, and it should - it will keep you on your toes before you support it recklessly, without having a solid reason to believe I will finish developing all these features. </p>

<p>This blog is meant partly as a dev diary. Nothing spectacular, just a bunch of random thoughts and insights into the process; I figured developing apps for WP isn’t as straightforward as some could think (or present to others), so should anyone embark on a similar journey, I hope this will answer at least a few questions down the way. The other part of the reason for its existence is that I enjoy spawning some musings on various topics from time to time. Don’t worry though, I’ll make sure they are tagged appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-androidios">Why not Android/iOS?</h2>

<p>I can’t care less for the platform I’m developing for. In fact, I dislike the whole business in general. In this particular case, I turned out to have a phone that’s unable to let me play Go while travelling and that pissed me off. I got curious if I can solve this issue with my limited knowledge of languages beside C/C++ and so here we are. As long as Android lets you write code in C++, I’ll try and separate the engine and underlying logic-based features from system-specific implementation, so you will be free to port the thing there. As for iOS, I have no desire to learn Obj-C nor Swift just to have the client available there, but again - you’re free to take the code from here, rewrite it in your language of choice and publish it in Apple Store. I’m pretty sure both these platforms do have access to Java-based clients, so there’s that.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-help">Can I help?</h2>

<p>Pull requests are always welcome. I give you no guarantee that the submitted code will be used or even partially used in the process, but you can always ask whether the particular part you are interested in modifying needs work.</p>

<p class="parind">You can expect rather frequent updates in here whenever I’m doing actual progress with the project. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me by mail or Twitter, or IRC (yakcyll@quakenet). If you are interested in competitive gaming, take a look at my previous blog at <a href="http://roadtoprem.blogspot.com">http://roadtoprem.blogspot.com</a>. I’m aware it might spark distrust, but there’s a lot of thoughts saved there I still identify with.</p>
