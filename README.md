# ygc development repo

Home of the ygc, an IGS Go client for Windows Phone 8.1.

## uwotm8?

It's an awful state of things when you want to play, practice or learn about your favorite game and you are (un)lucky enough to own a mobile device that is artificially limited in terms of providing you with means to do so just because there's been no one who could've been arsed to write a proper client in C#/C++ and XAML.

Should you stumble upon this repo in an unfinished state, both do and don't keep your hopes up. When I started it, I had no idea about writing mobile or web apps at all; the only thing going for me was having a lot of experience with C++ and since I just got a phone running WP8.1, which (sic!) lacked Java support, I decided to give this project a go. It's a learning project for me, but at the same time, I'm fairly determined to push it all the way to the state where I'd feel it's complete. It might be slow and you might feel inclined to poke me about it (feel free to do so by the way!), but it should be done.

## What about KGS?

gokgs.com ToS prohibits using custom clients on their server, so I had to go with IGS for starters. If ygc ever reaches a usable, store-ready state, I might contact the developers behind KGS about adding support for it.

## Is this gonna be free?

Aye, the code will be released under the MIT license. Should there be any content to pay for, it will be something that could be stored in a knowledge database: lessons, problems, replays, reviews, what have you. If I manage to get to that point, I will figure out a way to let users save and upload their own content though.

## Is there any way to follow the project closer?

I'm planning to run a jekyll blog on GitHub Pages; you might already find it at https://yakcyll.github.io/.
